Type decimal address to view memory,  q  to quit or  c  to continue: 99
     the location   99 has value 1111111111111111 , or 65535  or signed     -1

(The 99 enetered here is for the .LOC 100, we jump down to 100 because all
   of the relevant data is stored here)

Type  <Enter>  to continue debugging
Type        q  to quit
Type        f for forward range
Type        b for backward range: f
Type the number of forward locations to dump: 12
     the location  100 has value 0000000000000011 , or     3  or signed      3
(our first fib number)

     the location  109 has value 0010010100010001 , or  9489  or signed   9489
(the fib of 25... kind of. The largest number that can be stored in this
  architecture is 32k. So the real fib of 25 is 32k + 32k + 9489 = 75025)
