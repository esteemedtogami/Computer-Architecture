I believe I was 100% successful with this program. Using Professor
Moloney's class code as a base, I changed the Fib function from a
iterative solution to a recursive solution. The hardest part was
translating the C code "fn1 = rfib(n-1)" but after keeping track
of how things were being placed on the stack and being able to
increment the stack pointer to move around as needed, managing 
temporary data became clearer.
