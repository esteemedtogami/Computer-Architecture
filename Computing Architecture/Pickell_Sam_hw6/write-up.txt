I feel as though I was 90% successful with this program. Using the
code Professor Moloney gave in class, I was able to make a linker
in C that linked together a series of assembly level functions into
a single program. The linker portion of this assignment works as intended
as far as my testing has gone. The reason I feel that I was 90% successful
and not 100% is because I didn't get assignment 5 to work properly, so
as a result my functions are incorrect. Therefore I was not able to
extensively test this program. However, the linker appears to work as
evident by my consolidated object file.
