I think that I was 70% successful with this project. After spending many
hours working on the project and rewatching the lectures that explained
the project, I was not able to get it to work. However, I do think my
logic made sense and my commented prom file helps walkthrough my thought
process. Neither prom nor masm successfully compiled, and their 
errors are displayed in my output.txt file. I think the edits I made to the
mic1symasm_nand_rshift.c and ll files were logical and straightforward. So
even though prom nor masm compiled, I did put a lot of time and effort into
this program, and prom does contain the rshift as discussed in class and
my attempts at mult and div.
