I feel as though I was 95% successful with this project. All emulated output
results match hardware results for the inputs provided on the website
except for the last two numbers: 25e37 and 15e37. I realize the hardware is
supposed to output "inf" but I can't seem to figure out why my result
isn't 4e38. Otherwise using Professor Moloney's class code as a base, I
finished the code for determining the shift, the final mantissa result,
figuring out if the hidden bit was on or not and displaying the final
result.
