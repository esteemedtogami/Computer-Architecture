I feel as though I was 70% successful with this project.
I was not able to figure out how to print to the screen
using mic1 architecture, so I was not able to see if
my added functions worked. I did comment nearly every
line that I added unless it was duplicated or self 
explainitory, so hopefully it is easy to at least follow 
my logic throughout the program.
