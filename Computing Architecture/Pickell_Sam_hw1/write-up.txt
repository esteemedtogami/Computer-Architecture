I believe I was 99% successful with this program. Using Professor Moloney's
class code as a base and then using C++ from there, I used the bit_string 
array to display the necessary binary information in my output, and made
sure that that was working. Next I worked on formatting my output so that
it matched that of Professor Moloney. Finally, and this is where I believe
I was 1% unsuccessful, I took the information in bit_string and put that
information into separate strings and manually converted the binary into
hexadecimal and stored the result in a string. The reason I think I was
1% unsuccessful is I never utilized exponenet and mantissa in the
f_bits structure. I couldn't figure out a way to utilize them and found 
that to me the string method was a bit clearer, although a little time
consuming. From what I've tested and displayed in output_file.txt, however,
the program seems to work as intended.
